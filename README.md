> A puzzle-platformer about escaping your own creation, one echo at a time.

## ðŸŽ® Description

**L.E.A.V.E** is a short 2D puzzle-platformer built for GMTK Game Jam 2025.  
You play as a placeholder square â€” dropped into the game world by a distracted Creator. But something wakes up inside you.

Leave behind frozen echoes of yourself, return to the beginning, and use your past to climb your way out of an unfinished simulation.

---

## ðŸ§© Core Mechanic

Press **[Space]** to leave a shadow â€” a frozen clone that stays where you stood.  
Your main body resets to the start position.  
Use up to **3 shadows** to solve platforming puzzles and escape upward through layers of environments.

Shadows are solid and can be used:
- as platforms
- to activate triggers
- to block hazards
- to assist future versions of yourself

You can press **[Q]** to remove all shadows and retry without restarting the level.
